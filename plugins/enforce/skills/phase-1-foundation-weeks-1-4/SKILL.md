# Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)

## When to Use This Skill

Phase 1 establishes the foundation of SDLC security through two critical control layers:

1. **[Pre-commit Hooks](pre-commit-hooks.md)** - Block bad code locally before git commit
2. **[Branch Protection](branch-protection.md)** - Prevent unauthorized merges at repository level

These controls work together to create defense-in-depth at the source code level.
