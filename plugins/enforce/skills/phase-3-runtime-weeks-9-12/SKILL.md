# Phase 3: Runtime (Weeks 9-12)

## When to Use This Skill

Phase 3 extends enforcement to runtime through three critical areas:

1. **[Policy Enforcement](policy-enforcement.md)** - Core Kyverno policies for resource limits, image verification, security context
2. **[Advanced Policies](advanced-policies.md)** - Namespace quotas, pod security standards, network policies
3. **[Rollout Strategy](rollout.md)** - Audit-first deployment approach and metrics

These controls ensure only compliant workloads run in production.
