# Phase 2: Automation (Weeks 5-8)

## When to Use This Skill

Phase 2 extends enforcement into the CI/CD pipeline through two critical areas:

1. **[CI/CD Gates](ci-gates.md)** - Required checks, SBOM generation, vulnerability scanning, SLSA provenance
2. **[Evidence Collection](evidence-collection.md)** - Automated archival and metrics tracking

These controls ensure failing builds never reach production and provide audit evidence.
