# SLSA Implementation Playbook

## When to Use This Skill

Turn supply chain security from aspirational to operational.

> **What This Playbook Delivers**
>
>
> Clear implementation path from SLSA Level 1 to Level 3. Resolve SLSA vs SBOM confusion. Classify self-hosted runners correctly. Build verification workflows that actually work.


## Prerequisites

Before implementing SLSA:

- GitHub Actions (or equivalent CI/CD platform)
- Release artifact publishing (GitHub Releases, container registry)
- Basic understanding of cryptographic signing
- Decision on GitHub-hosted vs self-hosted runners
