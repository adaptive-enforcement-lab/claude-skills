# Kyverno Pod Security Templates

## When to Use This Skill

Pod security policies prevent privilege escalation, restrict dangerous capabilities, and enforce security boundaries for containerized workloads.

> **Pod Security Standards Replace PSP**
>
> PodSecurityPolicy was deprecated in Kubernetes 1.21 and removed in 1.25. Use Pod Security Standards (PSS) via admission controllers or Kyverno policies instead.



## Implementation
