# Kyverno Mutation Templates

## When to Use This Skill

Mutation policies modify resources at admission time, before they're persisted to etcd. This approach enforces standards without blocking deployments or requiring manual manifest updates.



## Implementation


See the full implementation guide in the source documentation.


## Examples

See [examples.md](examples.md) for code examples.
