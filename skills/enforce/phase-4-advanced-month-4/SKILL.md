# Phase 4: Advanced (Month 4+)

## When to Use This Skill

Phase 4 completes the implementation with three critical areas:

1. **[Audit Evidence Collection](audit-evidence.md)** - Automated archival of branch protection, PR reviews, signatures, SBOMs
2. **[Compliance Validation](compliance.md)** - OpenSSF Scorecard, Best Practices Badge, SLSA verification, license checks
3. **[Audit Simulation](audit-simulation.md)** - Mock audit timeline, gap analysis, remediation

These controls provide continuous proof of compliance.
