# Kyverno Resource Governance Templates

## When to Use This Skill

Resource governance policies prevent overconsumption, enforce autoscaling requirements, and control storage allocation across your cluster.

> **Resource Limits Prevent Noisy Neighbors**
>
> Without resource limits, a single pod can consume all node capacity and starve other workloads. Enforce limits to guarantee fair resource allocation.



## Implementation


See the full implementation guide in the source documentation.


## Examples
