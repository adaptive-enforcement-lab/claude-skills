# Secret Scanning Integration

## When to Use This Skill

Prevention is good. Detection is essential. Assume secrets will leak. Build systems to catch them before damage spreads.

> **The Risk**
>
>
> Secrets leak through commits, workflow logs, artifacts, pull requests, and third-party integrations. Without automated scanning, credentials remain exposed for days or months before detection. By then, your infrastructure is already compromised.
