# Secret Rotation Patterns

## When to Use This Skill

Secrets don't age well. Automate rotation before credentials become liabilities.

> **The Risk**
>
>
> Long-lived credentials are time bombs. Every day a secret remains unchanged increases the probability it has already leaked. Rotation limits blast radius when compromise happens, not if.



## Implementation


See the full implementation guide in the source documentation.
