# GitHub Actions Security Patterns Hub

## When to Use This Skill

Consolidated, authoritative resource for securing GitHub Actions workflows. From action pinning to runner hardening, we cover what vendor cheat sheets miss.

> **Why This Hub Exists**
>
>
> GitHub Actions security guidance is scattered across vendor cheat sheets from GitGuardian, StepSecurity, Salesforce, and Wiz. No single authoritative source exists. This hub consolidates production-tested patterns for DevSecOps teams.
