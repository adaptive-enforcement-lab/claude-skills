# Risk Prioritization Framework for Engineers

## When to Use This Skill

Most teams have an unlimited list of vulnerabilities but finite resources. The difference between effective security and security theater is how you make triage decisions.

This framework gives you:

1. **Objective metrics** to compare disparate vulnerabilities
2. **Decision trees** for patch-now vs patch-later choices
3. **Cost-benefit analysis** for remediation tradeoffs
4. **Real-world examples** with concrete decisions

The goal: **Spend your security budget where exposure is highest**.
