# Self-Hosted Runner Hardening

## When to Use This Skill

Hardening is not optional. Every layer of defense you skip is an attack vector you gift to adversaries. Deploy runners defensively or accept the breach.

> **The Default Is Insecure**
>
>
> A default runner installation has root access, unrestricted network, cloud metadata endpoints, persistent filesystem, and ambient credentials. One malicious workflow means full infrastructure compromise. Apply every hardening layer.
