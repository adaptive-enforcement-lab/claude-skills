# Hardened Deployment Workflow

## When to Use This Skill

Copy-paste ready deployment workflow templates with comprehensive security hardening. Each example demonstrates OIDC authentication, environment protection, approval gates, zero-downtime deployments, and automated rollback patterns.

> **Complete Security Patterns**
>
>
> These workflows integrate all security patterns from the hub: OIDC federation (no stored secrets), environment protection with approval gates, SHA-pinned actions, minimal GITHUB_TOKEN permissions, deployment verification, and automated rollback. Use as production templates for secure deployments.
