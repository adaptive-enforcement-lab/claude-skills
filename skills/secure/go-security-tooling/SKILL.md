# Go Security Tooling

## When to Use This Skill

Security-focused tooling built into the Go ecosystem. No exotic tools needed. Everything is standard, integrated, and runs every commit.

> **Boring is Better**
>
> Go's "boring" standard tools catch real vulnerabilities because they're frictionless to run. Exotic tools gather dust. Standard tools run on every commit.
