# Reliability Patterns

## When to Use This Skill

Production event systems must handle failures gracefully. Network blips, service outages, and malformed events are inevitable. These patterns ensure events don't get lost and systems recover automatically. For the complete reference, see the [official Argo Events reliability docs](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-events/sensors/more-about-sensors-and-triggers/).
