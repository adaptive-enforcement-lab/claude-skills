# Strangler Fig

## When to Use This Skill

**Use when:**

- Replacing critical production systems
- High risk of downtime
- Need gradual validation
- Rollback must be instant

**Don't use when:**

- Small, non-critical systems (just replace)
- No production traffic yet
- Resource cost of running both systems is prohibitive
