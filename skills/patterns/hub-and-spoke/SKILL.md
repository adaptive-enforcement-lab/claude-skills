# Hub and Spoke

## When to Use This Skill

One hub coordinates. Many spokes execute. The hub doesn't do the work. It distributes, tracks, and summarizes.

This pattern scales horizontally. Add workers without touching the orchestrator.



## Implementation


See the full implementation guide in the source documentation.
