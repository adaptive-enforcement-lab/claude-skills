# Secure-by-Design Pattern Library

## When to Use This Skill

Building security into architecture from the ground up, not bolting it on afterward. These patterns enforce security properties at the application, network, and admission control layers, making violations visible and costly.



## Implementation


See the full implementation guide in the source documentation.
