# Patterns

## When to Use This Skill

This section documents **architecture patterns**, **efficiency patterns**, **error handling patterns**, and **technology-specific patterns** that apply from GitHub Actions to Argo Workflows to Kubernetes operators.

These patterns are battle-tested in production environments, proven to reduce operational toil, and designed to prevent the failure modes that break automation at scale.



## Implementation


See the full implementation guide in the source documentation.


## Examples

See [examples.md](examples.md) for code examples.
