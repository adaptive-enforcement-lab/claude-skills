# Efficiency Patterns

## When to Use This Skill

Efficiency patterns optimize **what** your automation does and **whether** it needs to do it.

| Pattern | When to Use | Strategy |
| --------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| [Idempotency](idempotency/index.md) | Operations may be retried | Same input = same result |
| [Work Avoidance](work-avoidance/index.md) | Results can be cached | Skip if already done |
