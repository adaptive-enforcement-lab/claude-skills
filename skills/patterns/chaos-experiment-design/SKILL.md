# Chaos Experiment Design

## When to Use This Skill

Chaos without validation is just breaking things. Proper experiment design transforms fault injection into reliability engineering.

> **Core Principle**
>
> Every chaos experiment must have a hypothesis, measurable success criteria, controlled blast radius, and automated validation. If you can't measure it, you can't learn from it.
