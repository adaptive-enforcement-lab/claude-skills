# Testing Strategies

## When to Use This Skill

A well-tested CLI uses different testing strategies at different levels. This section covers:

- **[Unit Testing](unit-testing.md)** - Fake clients and interface-based design
- **[Integration Testing](integration-testing.md)** - envtest and real API servers
- **[E2E Testing](e2e-testing.md)** - Full workflow tests in CI/CD
