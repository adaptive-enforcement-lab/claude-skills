# Command Architecture

## When to Use This Skill

A well-designed CLI has commands that work both independently and as part of larger workflows. This section covers:

- **[Orchestrator Pattern](orchestrator-pattern.md)** - Coordinate multi-step workflows
- **[Subcommand Design](subcommand-design.md)** - Build independently useful commands
- **[Input/Output Contracts](io-contracts.md)** - Design for pipelines and automation
