# Common Operations

## When to Use This Skill

A well-designed Kubernetes CLI provides idiomatic operations that work consistently across resource types. This section covers:

- **[List Resources](list-resources.md)** - Query resources with label selectors
- **[Rollout Restart](rollout-restart.md)** - Trigger rolling restarts without downtime
- **[ConfigMap Operations](configmap-operations.md)** - Store and retrieve configuration data
- **[Watch Resources](watch-resources.md)** - React to real-time resource changes
