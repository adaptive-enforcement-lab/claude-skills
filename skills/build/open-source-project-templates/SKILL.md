# Open Source Project Templates

## When to Use This Skill

Copy-paste templates for open source project documentation based on real OpenSSF Best Practices Badge certification work. CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md, and GitHub issue forms with realistic SLAs and proven compliance.

> **Source Material**
>
> These templates come from the [readability project's OpenSSF certification](https://github.com/adaptive-enforcement-lab/readability) (PRs [#93](https://github.com/adaptive-enforcement-lab/readability/pull/93), [#94](https://github.com/adaptive-enforcement-lab/readability/pull/94), [#95](https://github.com/adaptive-enforcement-lab/readability/pull/95)).

## Implementation

See the full implementation guide in the [source documentation](https://adaptive-enforcement-lab.com/build/open-source-templates/).


## Key Principles

How these templates satisfy OpenSSF Badge criteria:

| Criterion | Template | Compliance |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| **Documentation** | CONTRIBUTING.md | ✅ Explains how to contribute |
| **Bug Reporting** | Bug Report template | ✅ Structured process |
| **Enhancement Proposals** | Feature Request template | ✅ Clear submission path |
| **Security Process** | SECURITY.md | ✅ Disclosure mechanism |
| **Response Timelines** | SECURITY.md SLAs | ✅ Realistic commitments |
| **Testing Requirements** | CONTRIBUTING.md | ✅ Coverage thresholds |
| **Code Review** | CONTRIBUTING.md PR process | ✅ Approval requirements |

### Badge Checklist Mapping

✅ **Contributing file**: CONTRIBUTING.md with setup, testing, PR process

✅ **Bug reporting**: Issue templates with structured fields

✅ **Enhancement proposals**: Feature request template

✅ **Security disclosure**: SECURITY.md with private channel (Security Advisories)

✅ **Security response**: Documented SLAs (48hr initial, 7 day update, 90 day resolution)
