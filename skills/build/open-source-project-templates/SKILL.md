# Open Source Project Templates

## When to Use This Skill

Copy-paste templates for open source project documentation based on real OpenSSF Best Practices Badge certification work. CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md, and GitHub issue forms with realistic SLAs and proven compliance.

> **Source Material**
>
> These templates come from the [readability project's OpenSSF certification](https://github.com/adaptive-enforcement-lab/readability) (PRs [#93](https://github.com/adaptive-enforcement-lab/readability/pull/93), [#94](https://github.com/adaptive-enforcement-lab/readability/pull/94), [#95](https://github.com/adaptive-enforcement-lab/readability/pull/95)).
