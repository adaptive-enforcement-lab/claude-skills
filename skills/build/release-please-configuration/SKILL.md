# Release-Please Configuration

## When to Use This Skill

Release-please reads your commit history and:

1. Groups changes by type (feat, fix, chore, etc.)
2. Generates changelogs
3. Bumps versions according to semantic versioning
4. Creates pull requests for releases
5. Tags releases when PRs merge
