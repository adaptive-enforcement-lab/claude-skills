# Kubernetes Integration

## When to Use This Skill

A well-designed Kubernetes CLI works seamlessly both on developer laptops and inside cluster pods. This section covers:

- **[Client Configuration](client-configuration.md)** - Automatic config detection for all environments
- **[RBAC Setup](rbac-setup.md)** - Service accounts and permissions
- **[Common Operations](common-operations/index.md)** - List, patch, and restart resources
